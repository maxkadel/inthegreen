Budgeting advice always starts with "save a month's worth of money" - but what if that's not possible for you right now, if you keep hitting late fees and overdraft fees? 

The intention of this app is to let you know if you're projected to go over budget between now and your next paycheck, so you can make choices to try to avoid overdraft fees and late fees.

Living in poverty is hard and stressful, and you can't actually budget your way out of it. But knowing what's going on with your money empowers you to make informed choices.
